# Stylie - A CSS 3 animation tool

Stylie is a fun tool for easily creating CSS 3 animations. Quickly design your
animation graphically, grab the generated CSS and go!  To learn how to use the
app, either run it locally (see below) or go to
http://jeremyckahn.github.io/stylie/ and click the "?" icon in the header for a
manual.

## Install locally

Requirements:

* Node[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)/NPM,
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) (version 1.0 or above)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)

Clone this repo and install the dependencies:

````
npm install && bower install
````

To run the app:

````
grunt serve
````

You can now access Stylie from http://localhost:9000.

## Developing Stylie

_Note: The whole build process is sort of crazy, and it doesn't follow any
patterns in particular.  The current setup is engineered around a project goal
to just be able open the top-level `index.html` file and start using the app.
It's also designed around running statically as a [Github
pages](http://pages.github.com/) site.  If you have an idea on how to engineer
the build system in a cleaner way, please make a Pull Request or a suggestion
on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/stylie/issues)._

Stylie is open source, so you are welcome to make changes.  If you do, you'll
want to use `dev.html`, not `index.html`.  The latter is generated by the build
process.

You can build the project with:

````
grunt build
````

Ta-da!  The JavaScript binary (`bin/app.js`), CSS, and `index.html` will be
generated.  Aside from the JavaScript, `dev.html` and `index.html` share all of
the same asset files.
